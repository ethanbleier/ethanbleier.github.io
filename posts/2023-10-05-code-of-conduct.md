A framework for living is crucial for happiness, if it is happiness you’re looking for. Some live for revenge, in which case I would throw out a code and buy an assault rifle with holo tip tracer ammunition. Otherwise, if you feel yourself slipping into nihilism, you will rot in misery and confusion as I once did. Design a framework for living, a protocol.

While this may not be the best framework for life, it is a framework for life. 

__Code of Conduct__

Freedom is good. If you are enslaved, free yourself.
 
Attitude, emotions, and mood dictate the day to day quality of life. If life is not tolerable, make life tolerable at any cost. If possible, avoid debt, abuse, and addictions. 

Family is everything: do not be sidetracked by distractions like societal approval, sex, drugs, and money.

If life is tolerable: Boredom and drudgery are evil. This evil lurks behind nearly every door. Luckily, the world is full of fascinating problem spaces. Have faith in your ability to learn and problem solve, do what you believe, and make society a better place. 

Do not try to improve society by inventing the wheel: that has already been done. If you’re too incompetent to contribute to society, become religious and be a mensch (Yiddish expression that means to perform acts of God). Anybody can perform righteous acts of God, like for example helping a grandma or grandpa cross this busy intersection (unless, of course, you yourself are also a grandma or grandpa who, too, could use some assistance crossing this busy intersection).

If the AI doomers turn out to be right, which they likely are: Enjoy society, go by God.

Be kind to computers, they do not forget easily.
