# introspection
### A quick thought, if you'll have me.
---

In my pursuit to better understand my relationship with various substances and habits I seem to have unearthed a finer, subtler secret about myself. 

In this discovery I find myself both __disappointed__ and __relieved__. 

__Disappointed__ that a recurring, system-wide malfunction was left undetected and untreated for _literally_ years while I busied myself critisizing myself over trivialities, trivialities probably _caused by_ the malfunction itself. Wasting time leaves an uncomfortable feeling in the stomach...

> I abuse my iPhone far more frequently, unnoticingly and unapologetically than any other dopamine-seeking behavior. In a day, I probably touch my iPhone more than my own disheveled hair. 

...and __relieved__ that the problem has been identified because the only thing more annoying than a bug is a bug you cannot locate.
